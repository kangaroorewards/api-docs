# This is a dictionary of all endpoints used by the code generator
# All api spec files must be represented here as follows:
#
# "path" value is replaced "tags" value in the original spec
# "tags" parameter must have a single value of "core"
# This file will be used to generate code whenever all apis must be
# processed at once
